# Week 6: JS I
## Goals ðŸŒŸ
By the end of this week, you will have a basic understanding of JavaScript and its syntax. You will be able to use variables, primitive data types, loops, functions, conditionals, objects, and arrays to write basic JavaScript programs. You will also learn about basic debugging techniques and how to perform CRUD operations in JavaScript.

## Next Steps
After completing this week, you should feel comfortable with the basics of JavaScript.  You can start practicing by building simple JavaScript programs and experimenting with different data types, loops, and functions.

You can now move on to more advanced topics such as DOM manipulation.
