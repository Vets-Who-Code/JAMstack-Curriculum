# Week 8 - JS II

## Goals ðŸŒŸ
By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Understand and use advanced JavaScript concepts such as scope, hoisting, closures, and High Order Functions.
- Understand the basics of RESTful APIs and how to work with JSON data.
- Understand and implement AJAX requests and asynchronous JavaScript.

## Prerequisites
Before starting this week, you should have a good understanding of basic JavaScript concepts such as variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, and arrays. You should also have some experience with basic debugging in JavaScript.

    - What are closures?
    - How do closures work?
    - Benefits and drawbacks of using closures
    - What are High Order Functions?
    - Using High Order Functions for composition and abstraction
- REST and JSON
    - Understanding RESTful APIs
    - What is JSON?
    - JSON syntax and data types
    - Working with JSON data in JavaScript
- Asynchronous JavaScript
    - Understanding synchronous vs. asynchronous code
