# Week 9 - New JavaScript

## Goals ðŸŒŸ
When this week is complete, we will have a better understanding of some of the newer features in JavaScript that can improve our coding efficiency and help us write more modern code. We'll also learn how to use Babel to make our code compatible with older browsers.

In Week 9, we will:

- Learn about the new syntax features in JavaScript, such as rest and spread, optional chaining, and destructuring
- Learn about new looping features, such as for...of and for...in
- Learn about class syntax and how to use it
- Learn how to use Babel to transpile our code to work in older browsers

## Prerequisites
Before starting this week, you should have completed all the JS I, DOM Manipulation, and JS II.

## Syllabus
- Rest and Spread
    - Spread syntax
    - Rest syntax
- Optional Chaining
- Destructuring
- Looping Over Iterable Objects
    - for...of
    - for...in
- Class Syntax
    - Class declaration
    - Class inheritance
- Babel
    - What is Babel?
    - Configuring Babel
    - Transpiling with Babel

## Next Steps
Our next step will be to move on to the next phase where we'll look at applying JavaScript at scale.
