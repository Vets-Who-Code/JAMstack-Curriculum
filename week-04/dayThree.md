## Embedding HTML and Images

iframe `<iframe></iframe>`

`iframe` elements are designed to allow you to embed other web documents into the current document.
 This is great for incorporating third-party content into your website that you might not have direct control over and don't want to have to implement your own version of â€” such as video from online video providers, commenting systems like Disqus, maps from online map providers, advertising banners, etc. The live editable examples you've been using through this course are implemented using iframes.


 ## Multimedia HTML

 `<video></video>`

 The HTML Video element `<video>` embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. 

 `<img>`

 The HTML `<img>` element embeds an image into the document.
