###  **Heaps**

#### Lesson Overview

In this lesson, we'll focus on the concept of heaps, specifically min-heaps and max-heaps. We'll discuss what they are, how they work, and explore their various properties.

#### Objectives

- Understand what a heap is and its characteristics.
- Differentiate between min-heaps and max-heaps.
- Learn the basic operations performed on heaps.

#### What is a Heap?

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It is essentially an almost complete binary tree, meaning all levels of the tree are fully filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right. In a heap, for any given node \( I \), the value of \( I \) is either greater than or equal to (in a max-heap) or less than or equal to (in a min-heap) the values of its children.

#### Min-Heap

In a min-heap, the smallest element is found at the root. Additionally, each parent node has a value less than or equal to the values of its children.

**Properties of Min-Heap:**

- Root node is the minimum element.
- Used in algorithms like Dijkstra's.

**Example Code in JavaScript for Min-Heap**

```javascript
class MinHeap {
  constructor() {
    this.heap = [];
  }

  insert(value) {
    this.heap.push(value);
    this.heapifyUp();
  }

  heapifyUp() {
    // Implement heapify up logic
  }
}

const minHeap = new MinHeap();
minHeap.insert(3);
minHeap.insert(1);
minHeap.insert(6);
```

---

#### Max-Heap

In a max-heap, the largest element is located at the root. Each parent node has a value greater than or equal to the values of its children.

**Properties of Max-Heap:**

- Root node is the maximum element.
- Used in algorithms like Heap Sort.

**Example Code in JavaScript for Max-Heap**

```javascript
class MaxHeap {
  constructor() {
    this.heap = [];
  }

  insert(value) {
    this.heap.push(value);
    this.heapifyUp();
  }

  heapifyUp() {
    // Implement heapify up logic
  }
}

const maxHeap = new MaxHeap();
maxHeap.insert(3);
maxHeap.insert(1);
maxHeap.insert(6);
```

#### Conclusion

Understanding heaps, especially min-heaps and max-heaps, is crucial for optimizing algorithms and data storage. They are highly effective for implementing priority queues and making algorithms more efficient. By understanding their properties and how to manipulate them, you can solve a variety of real-world problems more efficiently.
