#### Combinatorics and Factorial Concepts

**What is Combinatorics?**

Combinatorics is the study of counting, arrangement, and combination. In algorithms, it often comes into play when we need to count possibilities or permutations.

**Factorials**

Factorials are the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given number. Factorials are frequently used in combinatorics, especially when calculating permutations and combinations.

**Activity**: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.

```javascript
// Activity: Factorial function
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

#### Introduction to Probability and Basic Statistics

**Why Probability?**

Probability theory is used to model uncertainty and make informed decisions based on incomplete information, which is critical in algorithms that deal with stochastic processes or random variables.

**Basic Statistics**

An understanding of basic statistical concepts like mean, median, and mode can be beneficial when working on algorithms that involve data analysis or optimization.

**Activity**: Write a function to calculate the mean of an array of numbers.

```javascript
// Activity: Calculate mean
function calculateMean(arr) {
  const sum = arr.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
  return sum / arr.length;
}
```
