#### Understanding Big O Notation

**What is Big O Notation?**

Big O notation is a mathematical way to express the upper bounds of an algorithm in the worst-case or average-case scenarios. It helps us to understand the performance characteristics of an algorithm and how it will scale.

**Types of Big O and Code Examples**

1. **O(1) - Constant Time Complexity**

    - The running time is constant and doesn't depend on the size of the input.

    ```javascript
    function findFirstElement(arr) {
      return arr[0];
    }
    ```

2. **O(log n) - Logarithmic Time Complexity**

    - The running time grows logarithmically as the input size increases.

    ```javascript
    function binarySearch(arr, target) {
      let left = 0;
      let right = arr.length - 1;
      while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;
        if (arr[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
        else right = mid - 1;
      }
      return -1;
    }
    ```

3. **O(n) - Linear Time Complexity**

    - The running time increases linearly with the size of the input.

    ```javascript
    function linearSearch(arr, target) {
      for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] === target) return i;
      }
      return -1;
    }
    ```

4. **O(n^2) - Quadratic Time Complexity**

    - The running time is proportional to the square of the size of the input.

    ```javascript
    function bubbleSort(arr) {
      for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < arr.length - 1 - i; j++) {
          if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
            [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

#### Evaluating Time and Space Complexity

**Time Complexity**

Understanding time complexity is crucial for optimizing algorithms. It allows you to predict how your algorithm will scale and whether it will run in a reasonable amount of time for larger inputs.

**Space Complexity**

Space complexity measures how much additional memory an algorithm needs. Efficient use of memory can be critical for modern computing tasks.

```javascript
// Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1)
function findMax(arr) {
  let max = -Infinity;
  for (let num of arr) {
    if (num > max) {
      max = num;
    }
  }
  return max;
}
```

#### Conclusion

Understanding Big O notation and evaluating the time and space complexities are not just academic exercises; they have a direct impact on how scalable and efficient your software is. These skills are invaluable for any software engineer, especially when you're dealing with large datasets or need highly optimized algorithms.

By the end of this lesson, you should be comfortable analyzing algorithms and understanding their efficiency in both time and space.
