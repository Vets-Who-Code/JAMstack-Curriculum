### **Selection Sort: Basics and Implementation**

#### Lesson Overview

Selection sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms that works by repeatedly selecting the minimum (or maximum) element from an unsorted part and moving it to the beginning (or end). This lesson explores the basics and how you can implement this algorithm in JavaScript.

#### Objectives

- Understand the fundamental concept behind the Selection Sort algorithm.
- Implement Selection Sort in JavaScript.

#### Topics Covered

1. **Basics of Selection Sort**

    - Selection sort operates by identifying the smallest (or largest) element in the unsorted section of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element.
    - The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), making it inefficient for large data sets.
    - The space complexity is \(O(1)\), which means it's an in-place sorting algorithm.

2. **Implementation in JavaScript**

    - To implement Selection Sort in JavaScript, you can use a nested for-loop structure to traverse the array and perform the necessary swaps.

    **JavaScript Implementation**

    ```javascript
    function selectionSort(arr) {
      const n = arr.length;

      for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        let minIndex = i;

        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
          if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
            minIndex = j;
          }
        }

        // Swap the found minimum element with the first element
        if (minIndex !== i) {
          [arr[i], arr[minIndex]] = [arr[minIndex], arr[i]];
        }
      }
      return arr;
    }
    ```

#### Conclusion

Selection Sort is a straightforward algorithm that's easy to implement but not suitable for sorting large data sets. It's essential to understand the underlying mechanics, even if you won't use it in production, as it lays the groundwork for understanding more complex algorithms.
