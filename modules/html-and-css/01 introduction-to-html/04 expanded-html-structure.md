# **HTML Document Structure**

Let's dive deeper into the fundamental components of an HTML document, building on our basic HTML structure introduction:

## **Tags:**
- HTML uses tags to define elements. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag (`<tagname>`) and a closing tag (`</tagname>`). For instance, `<p>` is the opening tag for a paragraph, and `</p>` is the closing tag.

## **Attributes:**
- Attributes provide additional information about an element. They are always specified in the opening tag and are generally given in a name/value format. E.g., `<a href="https://example.com">Example</a>` - Here, `href` is an attribute with the value "https://example.com".

## **HTML Skeleton:**

The basic skeleton of an HTML document consists of the `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.

### **- Doctype Declaration:**
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document as an HTML5 document. It helps browsers render the content correctly.

### **- Head Element:**
- The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the document, such as its title, links to styles, scripts, etc.

### **- Body Element:**
- The `<body>` element contains all the content that is visible to the user: text, images, links, etc.

## **Meta Tags:**

Inside the `<head>` section, `<meta>` tags define metadata about the document.

- **Character Set**: `<meta charset="UTF-8">` ensures that the document uses the UTF-8 character set, which includes most characters from all written languages.

- **Viewport**: Important for responsive design. `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` helps ensure that a website looks good on all devices, including mobiles.

## **Title Tag:**
- The `<title>` tag specifies the title of the web page. This title appears on the browser tab and is crucial for SEO: `<title>Your Page Title Here</title>`.

## **Linking CSS:**
- You can link external CSS files using the `<link>` element, making your webpage look more appealing: 
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
  ```

## **Browser Compatibility:**
- Not all browsers interpret HTML in the same way. While HTML5 aims to be universal, older browsers might not recognize some of its features. Websites like "Can I use" and tools like "Babel" can be used to check and ensure compatibility.

## **Validation:**
- Validating your HTML means checking it against the official specification. The W3C Markup Validation Service is a free online tool that can be used for this purpose. Valid HTML is more likely to be displayed correctly across browsers and is typically more accessible and SEO-friendly.

## **Sample Expanded HTML Structure:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Page Title Here</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    </header>
    <nav>
        <a href="#">Home</a> | 
        <a href="#">About</a> | 
        <a href="#">Contact</a>
    </nav>
    <section>
        <p>This is a sample paragraph. Welcome to the world of HTML!</p>
    </section>
    <footer>
        <p>Copyright Â© 2023 by MyWebsite</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
