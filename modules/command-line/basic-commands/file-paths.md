# File Paths

## Relative Paths
These are paths that are relative to the current directory. They do not start with the root directory `/`.

## Absolute Paths
These paths start with the root directory and provide the full path to a file or directory.

## `realpath`
The `realpath` command resolves symbolic links and outputs the absolute path to a file or directory.

## `dirname`
The `dirname` command outputs the directory part of a file path, stripping the last portion that is generally the filename.

## Summary
Understanding the concept of file paths, both relative and absolute, is fundamental when navigating and operating in a command-line environment. The `realpath` and `dirname` commands can be particularly useful for script-based tasks that require manipulating or identifying paths.
