# Wildcards

## `*`
The asterisk wildcard matches zero or more characters in a filename or directory name.

## `?`
The question mark wildcard matches any single character in place of the question mark.

## `[]`
The square brackets wildcard matches any one of the enclosed characters. Ranges can also be specified, like `[a-z]`.

## `{}`
The curly braces wildcard is used for pattern matching. It allows you to specify a list of strings to match against.

## Summary
Wildcards provide a way to simplify complex command-line operations. Understanding how to use `*`, `?`, `[]`, and `{}` will make tasks like file searching, renaming, and copying much more efficient.
