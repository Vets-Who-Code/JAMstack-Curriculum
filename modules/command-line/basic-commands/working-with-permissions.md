# Working with Permissions

## `chmod`
The `chmod` or "Change Mode" command is used to modify file and directory permissions. It allows you to set permissions for the owner, group, and others using either symbolic representation or octal numbers.

## `chown`
The `chown` or "Change Owner" command allows you to change the ownership of a file or directory. You can specify both the user and the group that should own the file.

## `chgrp`
The `chgrp` or "Change Group" command changes the group ownership of a file or directory. This is often used in tandem with `chown` for more granular control.

## `umask`
The `umask` command sets the default permissions for newly created files and directories. It's a way to control the initial permission settings in a systematic manner.

## Summary
Understanding and managing permissions is a critical aspect of system administration and file management. The `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`, and `umask` commands provide the tools you need to control access to your files securely.
