# Text Comparison

## `diff`
The `diff` command is used to compare two files line by line. It's a go-to utility for developers and sysadmins alike for checking changes between file versions.

### Advanced Usage
- `diff file1.txt file2.txt`: Shows the differences between `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`.

### Use-cases
- Identifying changes before committing to version control.
- Comparing configuration files.

## `comm`
The `comm` command is used to compare sorted files. Unlike `diff`, it can produce three-column output showing lines unique to each file and common to both.

### Advanced Usage
- `comm file1.txt file2.txt`: Compares `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` and outputs three columns for lines only in `file1.txt`, only in `file2.txt`, and in both.

### Use-cases
- Data analysis.
- Checking list differences.

## `cmp`
The `cmp` command compares two files byte by byte. It's faster than `diff` but less informative.

### Advanced Usage
- `cmp file1.txt file2.txt`: Compares `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` at the byte level.

### Use-cases
- Quick file comparisons.
- Checking file integrity.

## `patch`
The `patch` command applies changes to a file based on a patch file, often generated by `diff`.

### Advanced Usage
- `patch original.txt changes.patch`: Applies the changes described in `changes.patch` to `original.txt`.

### Use-cases
- Updating source code.
- Reverting previous changes.

## Summary
Text comparison utilities like `diff`, `comm`, `cmp`, and `patch` are fundamental for anyone working with text files, source code, or configuration files. These commands offer a variety of ways to compare and manipulate text, each serving specific use-cases. `diff` and `comm` are more verbose and detailed, useful for understanding the context of changes. In contrast, `cmp` is quick and direct, ideal for swift validations. `patch` complements these by enabling the application of changes based on comparison outputs. Mastering these tools will significantly boost your text manipulation capabilities.
