## Lesson: Learning Markdown with GitHub

### Basic Markdown Syntax

Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to be easy-to-read and easy-to-write. On GitHub, Markdown files have a `.md` extension. Learning the basics is simple. For example, you can use `#` for headers, `*` for bullet points, and `[Link text](URL)` to insert a hyperlink. These basics will help you create readable README files and issues.

### Advanced Markdown Features

Once you've got the hang of the basics, you can move on to advanced features like tables, code blocks, and nested lists. For tables, you can use the `|` and `-` characters to create rows and columns. Code blocks can be created using triple backticks and specifying the programming language right after the first set of backticks for syntax highlighting.

### GitHub Flavored Markdown

GitHub has its own set of additional Markdown features, known as GitHub Flavored Markdown. This includes syntax highlighting, task lists, and emojis. To create a task list, you can use `- [ ]` for an empty checkbox and `- [x]` for a checked one. For emojis, simply wrap the emoji code in colons like `:smile:`.

### Creating a Profile README (UI)

Want to make your GitHub profile stand out? You can create a special README that shows up when someone visits your profile page. To do this, create a new repository with the same name as your username, add a README file to it, and go wild with your Markdown skills to personalize it.

## Lesson: GitHub Features

### Issues and Discussions (UI)

Issues in GitHub serve as a way to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs. They are a form of a discussion board but more focused on actionable outcomes. GitHub Discussions, on the other hand, serve as a place for Q&A and open-ended conversations. Both are great tools for project management and community engagement.

### Actions (UI)

GitHub Actions lets you automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your GitHub repository. You can build, test, and deploy your code automatically based on triggers like push events or pull requests. The workflows are defined in `.yml` files within the `.github/workflows/` directory of your repository.

### GitHub Pages (UI)

With GitHub Pages, you can host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. This is perfect for project landing pages or personal portfolios. Just push your HTML files to a specific branch (usually `gh-pages`), and GitHub will deploy it as a website.

### Sponsoring Developers (UI)

Last but not least, GitHub allows you to financially support developers whose work you appreciate. This can be a one-time donation or a recurring sponsorship. GitHub does not charge fees for this service, so the developer gets the full amount of your support.
