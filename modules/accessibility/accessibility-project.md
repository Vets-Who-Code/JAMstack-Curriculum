# Unit 7: Project Time

## Lesson: Auditing Your VWC Prework Webpage

### Using Automated Tools

1. **WAVE**: Run your VWC Prework Webpage through the WAVE tool to find immediate issues.
2. **Axe**: Use the Axe browser extension for a more detailed accessibility report.

### Manual Checks

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through your webpage to check focus order.
2. **Visual Inspection**: Ensure elements are visually distinct and readable.

## Lesson: Implementing Fixes

### HTML Semantics

1. **Headers**: Use appropriate heading levels (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.).
2. **Lists**: Use `<ol>` or `<ul>` for lists.

### ARIA Landmarks

1. **Role Assignment**: Assign roles like `main`, `navigation`, and `complementary` to relevant sections.
2. **ARIA States**: Add states such as `aria-expanded` to interactive elements if needed.

### Text and Color Contrast

1. **Text**: Make sure your text contrasts well against its background.
2. **Links**: Ensure links are easily distinguishable from surrounding text.

## Lesson: Final Review and Next Steps

### Debugging

1. **Browser Dev Tools**: Use browser's developer tools to debug ARIA roles, tab index, etc.
2. **Validator**: Use W3C's HTML Validator to find and fix any markup errors.

### Final Testing

1. **Re-run Tools**: Use WAVE and Axe again to make sure all issues are fixed.
2. **Manual Check**: Perform another round of manual checks to confirm.

### Deploying Updates

1. **Git Commit**: Make sure to commit all your changes.
2. **Deploy**: Deploy your changes to the live website.

### Additional Resources

1. **WCAG Guidelines**: For a deeper dive.
2. **WebAIM Resources**: Articles, checklists, and tools for further learning.
