### What is ARIA?

ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It's a set of attributes that help make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities.

### Roles, States, and Properties

1. **Roles**: Define what an element is or does (e.g., `button`, `link`, `navigation`).
2. **States**: Describe the current condition of an element (e.g., `aria-expanded="true"`).
3. **Properties**: Provide additional semantics (e.g., `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`).

### ARIA Landmarks

1. **Purpose**: Help users navigate the page by defining areas like navigation, main content, and footers.
2. **Examples**: `role="navigation"`, `role="main"`, `role="complementary"`.
