## Lesson 1: Usability and Development

### Importance of Usability in Coding

- **User-Centric Code**: Usability isn't just about the UI; it extends to the code itself. Optimized, clean code affects load times and user interactions.
  
- **ROI**: Investments in usability pay off by reducing abandonment rates, increasing user engagement, and improving user satisfaction.

### Usability Testing for Development

- **Automated Testing**: Tools like Selenium can be used to automate user interaction tests.
  
- **User Feedback**: Gather real-world user data through alpha/beta testing to identify usability issues early on.

### Applying Usability Heuristics

- **10 Heuristics by Jakob Nielsen**: These are broad rules of thumb that offer quick evaluations of a user interface.
  
- **Practical Application**: For instance, applying the heuristic "Error Prevention" would involve adding safeguards in the code to prevent common user errors.

## Lesson 2: Integrating Accessibility into Development

### What is Web Accessibility?

- **Definition**: Making web content and applications accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities.
  
- **W3Câ€™s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)**: A set of guidelines and best practices for accessible web design.

### Ensuring Accessible Code

- **Semantic HTML**: Use HTML elements for their intended purpose (e.g., use `<button>` for buttons) to ensure screen readers can interpret them correctly.
  
- **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**: A set of attributes that help make web content and applications more accessible.

### Adhering to Accessibility Laws and Guidelines

- **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)**: These are a series of guidelines that developers should follow to make their websites accessible.
  
- **Legal Requirements**: Acts like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the U.S. make accessibility not just a best practice but a legal necessity.
