## Lesson 1: Wireframing for Effective Development

### Using Wireframes in Development

- **Clarity and Vision**: Wireframes provide a skeletal framework that helps everyone on the team understand the layout and functionality before coding begins.
  
- **Efficiency**: Saves time and resources as changes can be made in the wireframing stage rather than during development.

### Selecting Wireframing Tools

- **Figma and Canva**: Why these tools stand out for their user-friendly interface and collaborative features.

### Sketching Wireframes for Web Components

- **Step-by-Step Guide**: Creating basic wireframes for different web components like headers, footers, and navigation menus in Figma/Canva.

## Lesson 2: Digital Prototyping with Development Tools

### Introduction to Figma

- **Why Figma?**: Figma offers real-time collaboration, making it easier to work in teams.
  
- **Features for Prototyping**: Overview of Figma’s prototyping features like linking screens and adding transition effects.

### Creating Interactive Prototypes

- **Hands-on Exercise**: We'll walk you through creating an interactive prototype of a webpage from a wireframe.

### Styling Web Components in Prototypes

- **Design Tokens in Figma**: How to define and use design tokens for consistent styling.

## Lesson 3: Testing and Refining Prototypes

### User Testing Methods for Prototypes

- **Remote Usability Testing**: How to set this up in Figma.

- **Heat Maps**: Using Figma’s analytics tools to analyze which parts of your prototype users interact with the most.

### Gathering Feedback for Iteration

- **Annotations in Figma**: How to add annotations and comments to your prototype for better communication with stakeholders.

### Continuously Improving Prototypes

- **Versioning in Figma**: How to use version history to keep track of changes and iterations.

## Lesson 4: Advanced Figma Techniques for Development

### Leveraging Figma Plugins

- **Popular Plugins**: Plugins like Zeplin can be integrated for advanced development workflows.
  
### Collaborative Workflows with Teams

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Deep dive into how Figma allows multiple people to work on the same file in real-time.
  
- **Handoff to Developers**: How to export design specs and assets for developers to use during the coding phase.
