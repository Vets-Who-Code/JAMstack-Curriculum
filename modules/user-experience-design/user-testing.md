## Lesson 1: Types of User Testing

### Usability Testing

- **What It Is**: Assessing how easy a product is to use.
- **How to Conduct**: Use prototypes and get users to complete specific tasks while observing them.

### A/B Testing for Optimization

- **What It Is**: Comparing two versions (A and B) of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better.
- **How to Conduct**: Use analytics tools to track performance metrics of both versions.

### Eye Tracking for Attention Analysis

- **What It Is**: Observing where and how long a user looks at different areas on a webpage.
- **How to Conduct**: Requires specialized eye-tracking equipment; data is then analyzed to improve layout or design elements.

### Conducting Remote User Testing

- **What It Is**: Allows you to conduct usability testing with participants in their natural environment.
- **How to Conduct**: Use tools like Lookback.io to observe users remotely.

## Lesson 2: Conducting Effective User Tests

### Preparing for User Tests

- **Planning**: Decide on the objectives, what type of test to run, and who your participants are.
- **Test Scenarios**: Create realistic situations or tasks that the users can perform during the test.

### Executing User Test Sessions

- **Moderated vs. Unmoderated**: Moderated tests are real-time and interactive, whereas unmoderated tests are done independently by the user.
- **Data Collection**: Take notes, record sessions, or use heatmaps and analytics for more data.

### Analyzing User Feedback for Enhancements

- **Qualitative and Quantitative Data**: Gather both types of data for a comprehensive analysis.
- **Actionable Insights**: Turn the data into actionable tasks for your development cycle.
