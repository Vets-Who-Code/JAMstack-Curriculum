### Architectural Patterns in Software Engineering

#### Introduction
- **Objective**: Understand what architectural patterns are and how they are applied in software engineering.

#### What Are Architectural Patterns?
- **Definition**: Reusable high-level structures that provide a template for subdividing the components of a system.

#### Types of Architectural Patterns

1. **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**
   - **Use-Case**: Web Applications
   - **Components**: Model, View, Controller

2. **Layered Architecture**
   - **Use-Case**: Business Applications
   - **Components**: Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access Layer

3. **Client-Server**
   - **Use-Case**: Distributed Systems
   - **Components**: Client, Server

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - **Use-Case**: Real-time Processing Systems
   - **Components**: Event Emitters, Event Listeners

5. **Microservices**
   - **Use-Case**: Scalable & Maintainable Services
   - **Components**: Independent Services

#### Advantages and Disadvantages
- **MVC**
  - **Advantages**: Separation of concerns, easy to maintain
  - **Disadvantages**: Complexity can increase with a large codebase
- **Layered Architecture**
  - **Advantages**: Isolation of layers, easy to update
  - **Disadvantages**: Performance overhead, possible redundancy
- **Client-Server**
  - **Advantages**: Scalability, resource sharing
  - **Disadvantages**: Server bottlenecks, potential single point of failure
- **Event-Driven Architecture**
  - **Advantages**: Scalability, real-time processing
  - **Disadvantages**: Complexity, debugging can be challenging
- **Microservices**
  - **Advantages**: Scalability, independent deployment
  - **Disadvantages**: Network latency, complexity in management

#### Practical Examples
1. **MVC**: Implementing a simple CRUD application.
2. **Layered Architecture**: Designing a business application.
3. **Client-Server**: Setting up a basic HTTP server and client.
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Implementing a real-time notification system.
5. **Microservices**: Developing an e-commerce platform with independent services.

#### Summary
- Architectural patterns offer a set of guidelines for organizing code and system components.
