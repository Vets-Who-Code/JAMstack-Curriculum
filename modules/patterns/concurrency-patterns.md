### Concurrency Patterns in Software Engineering

---

#### Introduction
- **Objective**: Understand concurrency patterns and how they help manage multiple tasks simultaneously, specifically in a software engineering context.

#### What Are Concurrency Patterns?
- **Definition**: These are patterns that deal with the execution and management of multiple tasks in parallel.

#### Types of Concurrency Patterns

##### 1. Producer-Consumer
- **In-Depth Explanation**: One or more producers generate data and one or more consumers use the data.
- **Use-Case**: Data streams, queuing systems.
- **JavaScript Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const queue = [];
  
  function producer() {
    queue.push(Math.random());
  }
  
  function consumer() {
    if(queue.length > 0) {
      console.log(queue.shift());
    }
  }
  ```

##### 2. Locks and Mutexes
- **In-Depth Explanation**: A lock or mutex provides exclusive access to a resource.
- **Use-Case**: Resource sharing, critical sections.
- **JavaScript Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  let isLocked = false;

  function lock() {
    isLocked = true;
  }

  function unlock() {
    isLocked = false;
  }
  ```

##### 3. Futures and Promises
- **In-Depth Explanation**: Represent the result of an operation that has not yet completed.
- **Use-Case**: Asynchronous operations.
- **JavaScript Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Done!");
    }, 1000);
  });

  myPromise.then(result => console.log(result));
  ```

##### 4. Actor Model
- **In-Depth Explanation**: Encapsulates state and behavior, communicating only via messages.
- **Use-Case**: Object-oriented systems, distributed computing.
- **JavaScript Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  class Actor {
    constructor() {
      this.state = {};
    }
    receive(message) {
      // Handle the message
    }
  }
  ```

##### 5. Event Loop
- **In-Depth Explanation**: A design pattern for asynchronous programming.
- **Use-Case**: Web browsers, Node.js.
- **JavaScript Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("This is an async operation");
  }, 0);
  ```

#### Advantages and Disadvantages
- **Producer-Consumer**:
  - **Advantages**: Decoupling, flexibility.
  - **Disadvantages**: Synchronization overhead.
- **Locks and Mutexes**:
  - **Advantages**: Controlled access.
  - **Disadvantages**: Deadlocks, contention.
- **Futures and Promises**:
  - **Advantages**: Better code organization, error handling.
  - **Disadvantages**: Can get complex with nested promises.
- **Actor Model**:
  - **Advantages**: Scalability, message-passing semantics.
  - **Disadvantages**: Complexity, debuggability.
- **Event Loop**:
  - **Advantages**: Non-blocking, efficient.
  - **Disadvantages**: Hard to reason about, callback hell.

#### Summary
- Concurrency patterns are key to understanding how to manage multiple tasks effectively, providing structured ways to handle complexity and improve performance.
