## Introduction

File compression is not just about saving disk space; it's also about optimizing file transfers and even computational performance.

---

## `zip`

### Overview

`zip` is a utility for packaging and compressing files.

### Advanced Usage

#### Exclude Files

Exclude specific files from a zip archive.

```bash
zip archive.zip -r folder/ -x \*.git\*
```

#### Update Mode

Update an existing zip file with new files.

```bash
zip -u archive.zip newfile.txt
```

---

## `tar`

### Overview

`tar` is used primarily for archiving files, and can be combined with various compression algorithms.

### Advanced Usage

#### Incremental Backups

Create incremental backups to save only changed files since the last backup.

```bash
tar --listed-incremental=/path/to/snapshot.file -cvzf backup.tar.gz /path/to/folder
```

#### Remote Archiving

Archive a directory and pipe it through SSH to another machine.

```bash
tar czf - /path/to/dir | ssh user@host "cat > backup.tar.gz"
```

---

## `gzip`

### Overview

`gzip` is optimized for high compression ratios.

### Advanced Usage

#### Compression with a Name Suffix

Compress files and add a suffix.

```bash
gzip -S .archive large_file.txt
```

#### Concatenating Archives

Multiple `.gz` files can be concatenated into one.

```bash
cat file1.gz file2.gz > combined.gz
```

---

## `bzip2`

### Overview

`bzip2` usually offers better compression ratios compared to `gzip`.

### Advanced Usage

#### Decompress to STDOUT

Decompress directly to the standard output.

```bash
bzip2 -dc file.bz2
```

#### Parallel Compression

Use `pbzip2` for parallel and faster compression.

```bash
pbzip2 -p4 large_file.txt
```

## Comparison of Algorithms

- **Deflate**: Used in `zip` and `gzip`, offers fast compression but somewhat lower ratios.
- **Bzip2**: Slower but offers better compression ratios.

---

## Best Practices

- Consider the CPU cost when choosing a compression level.
- For long-term storage, use stable and well-supported formats.
- Always check the integrity of compressed archives before and after transferring them.
