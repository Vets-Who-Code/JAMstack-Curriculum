## Introduction

Managing `users` and `groups` is a cornerstone of Linux system administration. This in-depth lesson aims to provide a thorough understanding of user and group management, diving deep into key commands and their options.

## Deep Dive into `useradd`

### Key Options and Their Importance

- `-m`: This option creates a home directory. If omitted, no home directory is made, which is generally not recommended.
  
- `-e`: Sets the expiration date for the account. Useful for temporary accounts.

- `-p`: Allows you to set an encrypted password during user creation (rarely used because it's not secure to supply a password in the command line).

#### Real-world Example: 

Creating a new user with a custom home directory and an expiration date:

```bash
useradd -m -d /custom/home/jdoe -e 2023-12-31 jdoe
```

#### Behind The Scenes

When you add a user, entries are made in `/etc/passwd` for user information, `/etc/shadow` for password information, and `/etc/group` for group information.

## Deep Dive into `groupadd`

### Key Options and Their Importance

- `-g`: Allows you to specify a GID (Group ID). If omitted, the next available numerical GID is assigned.
  
- `-r`: Creates a system group. System groups often have lower GIDs and are generally not meant for humans.

#### Real-world Example:

Creating a system group with a specific GID:

```bash
groupadd -r -g 101 developers
```

#### Behind The Scenes

The group's information is stored in `/etc/group` and `/etc/gshadow`.

## The Power of `sudo`

### sudo vs. su

- `sudo` runs a single command with root privileges. 
- `su` switches the user entirely, requiring the root password.

### Real-world Example:

Running a command as another user:

```bash
sudo -u username command
```

#### Configuration

To edit the `sudoers` file safely, use `visudo`. Here, you can define who can run what.

## Securing Accounts with `passwd`

### Key Options and Their Importance

- `-l` and `-u`: Locking and unlocking accounts. When an account is locked, an exclamation mark is added in front of the encrypted password inside `/etc/shadow`.

#### Real-world Example:

Locking a user account:

```bash
passwd -l jdoe
```

#### Behind The Scenes

The actual passwords are not stored. Only a hashed version is kept, usually in the `/etc/shadow` file.
