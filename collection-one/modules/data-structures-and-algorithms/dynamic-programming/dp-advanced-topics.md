### **Advanced DP Topics: State Compression, DP with Bitmasking**

#### Lesson Overview

Dynamic programming (DP) is a versatile technique, but sometimes the problem we're tackling has too many states or dimensions to be solved traditionally. This lesson dives into advanced techniques like state compression and dynamic programming with bitmasking to make these problems more manageable.

#### Topics Covered

1. **State Compression**

    - State compression is a technique to map a large set of states into a smaller one, effectively reducing memory usage. This approach is useful for multi-dimensional DP problems.
    
    **Example in JavaScript: 2D DP Problem with State Compression**

    ```javascript
    function dpWithCompression(matrix) {
      const rows = matrix.length;
      const cols = matrix[0].length;
      const dp = Array(rows).fill(0).map(() => Array(1 << cols).fill(0));

      // Base case initialization

      // DP computation
      for (let r = 1; r < rows; ++r) {
        for (let mask = 0; mask < (1 << cols); ++mask) {
          for (let subMask = mask; ; subMask = (subMask - 1) & mask) {
            dp[r][mask] = Math.max(dp[r][mask], dp[r - 1][subMask] + calculateValue(matrix, r, mask));
            if (subMask === 0) break;
          }
        }
      }
      return dp[rows - 1][(1 << cols) - 1];
    }
    ```

2. **DP with Bitmasking**

    - Bitmasking allows us to represent and manipulate subsets efficiently, which is often a need in complex DP problems. By representing sets as bits in an integer, operations like addition, removal, and checking the presence of an element become bitwise operations, greatly speeding up the computation.
    
    **Example in JavaScript: Traveling Salesman Problem with Bitmasking**

    ```javascript
    function tsp(graph) {
      const n = graph.length;
      const dp = Array(1 << n).fill(Infinity).map(() => Array(n).fill(Infinity));

      dp[1][0] = 0; // Starting state

      for (let mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
        for (let u = 0; u < n; ++u) {
          if ((mask & (1 << u)) === 0) continue;

          for (let v = 0; v < n; ++v) {
            if ((mask & (1 << v)) === 0 || u === v) continue;

            const prevMask = mask ^ (1 << u);
            dp[mask][u] = Math.min(dp[mask][u], dp[prevMask][v] + graph[v][u]);
          }
        }
      }

      let res = Infinity;
      for (let u = 1; u < n; ++u) {
        if (graph[u][0] === 0) continue;
        res = Math.min(res, dp[(1 << n) - 1][u] + graph[u][0]);
      }
      return res;
    }
    ```
