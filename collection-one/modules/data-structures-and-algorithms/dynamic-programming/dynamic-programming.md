### **Advanced Techniques in Dynamic Programming: An Overview**

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a cornerstone of algorithm design, known for its ability to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. This collection of lessons delves into advanced DP techniques, each focusing on a unique aspect to optimize and solve a variety of computational challenges efficiently. Below is a summary of each lesson and a link to its detailed exploration.

#### 1. **Introduction to Dynamic Programming**
This foundational lesson introduces the principles of dynamic programming, setting the stage for more advanced topics. It covers the basics of DP, including its definition, key concepts, and initial applications.

#### 2. **Memoization**
Memoization is a technique that stores the results of expensive function calls to avoid redundant computations in future calls. This lesson explains how memoization works and demonstrates its application in optimizing recursive algorithms.

#### 3. **Tabulation**
As a bottom-up approach in dynamic programming, tabulation builds the solution iteratively and stores it in a table, avoiding the need for recursion. This lesson explores tabulation and its differences from memoization.

#### 4. **Bitmasking**
Bitmasking in DP is used to handle problems involving sets and combinations efficiently. This advanced technique allows for the representation of subsets and manipulation of their elements with bitwise operations.

#### 5. **State Compression**
State compression involves mapping a large set of states into a smaller one to reduce memory usage in multi-dimensional DP problems. This lesson discusses how state compression can make seemingly intractable problems manageable.
