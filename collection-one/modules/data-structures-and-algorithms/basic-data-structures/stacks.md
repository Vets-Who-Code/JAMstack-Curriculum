### **Stacks: Mastering Sequential Data Handling**

#### Lesson Overview

Stacks, embodying the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, are pivotal in computer science for managing data in a sequential manner. This lesson explores the essence of stacks, detailing their operations and demonstrating how to effectively implement and utilize them in programming tasks.

#### Objectives

- Decode the LIFO principle that underpins stack operations.
- Acquaint yourself with stack operations: pushing, popping, and peeking.

#### Unveiling Stacks

At its core, a stack is a linear data structure that restricts insertion and removal of elements to a single end, termed the top of the stack. This structure is analogous to a stack of plates or books, where the last item placed on the stack is the first to be removed, embodying the LIFO methodology.

#### Core Stack Operations

**Push Operation**

The `push` function adds a new element to the top of the stack, expanding its size and redefining the "top" element.

**Pop Operation**

Conversely, the `pop` function removes the current top element from the stack, returning its value and potentially decreasing the stack's size.

**Peek Operation**

The `peek` operation allows observation of the top element without altering the stack's structure, providing insight into the stack's current state.

**JavaScript Stack Implementation**

A practical JavaScript example demonstrates a stack implemented via an array, showcasing the simplicity with which stacks can be manipulated:

```javascript
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.items = []; // Initialize an empty array to hold stack elements
  }

  // Adds element to the stack
  push(element) {
    this.items.push(element);
  }

  // Removes and returns the top element
  pop() {
    if (this.items.length === 0) return 'Stack is empty';
    return this.items.pop();
  }

  // Returns the top element without removal
  peek() {
    return this.items[this.items.length - 1];
  }

  // Checks if the stack is empty
  isEmpty() {
    return this.items.length === 0;
  }
}

// Demonstrating stack operations
const myStack = new Stack();
myStack.push(1); // Stack: [1]
myStack.push(2); // Stack: [1, 2]
console.log(myStack.peek());  // Expected Output: 2
console.log(myStack.pop());   // Expected Output: 2, Stack: [1]
console.log(myStack.isEmpty());  // Expected Output: false
```

#### Conclusion

Stacks offer a streamlined approach to managing data in scenarios where order and reversibility are crucial, such as in browser history navigation, syntax parsing, and recursion handling. Understanding and implementing stack operations not only enhances your programming skill set but also prepares you for more complex data structure manipulations and algorithmic strategies. Through mastering stacks, you gain a powerful tool for solving a wide array of computational problems with elegance and efficiency.
