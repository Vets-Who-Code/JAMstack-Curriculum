### **Tries**

#### Lesson Overview

Tries are specialized trees used for efficient retrieval of key-value pairs, especially in scenarios that involve a large dataset of strings. This lesson delves into the basics of tries and the standard operations you can perform with them.

#### What is a Trie?

A trie, pronounced "try," is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, typically used to facilitate operations like retrieval, insertion, and deletion of keys in a dataset. Unlike binary trees, tries can have multiple children at each node, making them well-suited for storing dictionaries, phone books, and routing tables.

#### Basics of Tries

1. **Nodes and Edges**: Each node in a trie represents a single character of the keys. Edges between nodes represent the characters.

2. **Root Node**: The root node is the starting point and typically does not contain a character.

3. **End of Word Marker**: Nodes can have a boolean flag that specifies whether the string formed from the root to that node is a complete key in the dataset.

#### Operations on Tries

1. **Insertion**: Adding a new word involves traversing the trie according to each character in the word. Nodes are created for characters that are not already present.

    ```javascript
    function insertTrie(node, word) {
      let currentNode = node;
      for (let char of word) {
        if (!currentNode.children[char]) {
          currentNode.children[char] = new TrieNode();
        }
        currentNode = currentNode.children[char];
      }
      currentNode.isEndOfWord = true;
    }
    ```

2. **Search**: To find a word, you traverse the trie by following edges that correspond to each character of the word.

    ```javascript
    function searchTrie(node, word) {
      let currentNode = node;
      for (let char of word) {
        if (!currentNode.children[char]) return false;
        currentNode = currentNode.children[char];
      }
      return currentNode.isEndOfWord;
    }
    ```

3. **Deletion**: Deleting a word involves finding it first. After that, you backtrack and remove nodes that don't form any other words.

    ```javascript
    function deleteTrie(node, word) {
      // Perform search and deletion logic
    }
    ```

#### Conclusion

Understanding tries is vital for applications that require fast and efficient string-based lookups. They are fundamental in text analytics, auto-suggestions, and many other areas. Learning how to implement and operate on tries is an essential skill for mastering advanced data structures.
