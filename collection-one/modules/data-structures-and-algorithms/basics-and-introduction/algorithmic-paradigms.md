#### Understanding Big O Notation

**What is Big O Notation?**

Big O notation represents the upper limit of an algorithm's runtime or space requirements in the worst-case or average-case scenarios. It's essential for predicting how an algorithm performs as data input size grows, guiding us in choosing the most efficient approach.

**Exploring Big O with JavaScript Examples**

1. **O(1) - Constant Time Complexity**

    - Execution time remains unchanged regardless of input size.

    ```javascript
    function checkEvenNumber(num) {
      return num % 2 === 0;
    }
    // Regardless of the number's value, the operation takes constant time.
    ```

2. **O(log n) - Logarithmic Time Complexity**

    - Execution time increases logarithmically with input size, common in "divide and conquer" algorithms.

    ```javascript
    function findElementInSortedArray(arr, element) {
      let low = 0;
      let high = arr.length - 1;
      while (low <= high) {
        const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        const guess = arr[mid];
        if (guess === element) return mid;
        if (guess > element) high = mid - 1;
        else low = mid + 1;
      }
      return null;
    }
    ```

3. **O(n) - Linear Time Complexity**

    - Execution time grows linearly with input size.

    ```javascript
    function calculateSum(arr) {
      let sum = 0;
      for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
      }
      return sum;
    }
    ```

4. **O(n^2) - Quadratic Time Complexity**

    - Execution time increases quadratically with input size, typical in nested iterations.

    ```javascript
    function selectionSort(arr) {
      for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
        let minIndex = i;
        for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
          if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
            minIndex = j;
          }
        }
        if (minIndex !== i) {
          let temp = arr[i];
          arr[i] = arr[minIndex];
          arr[minIndex] = temp;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

#### Evaluating Time and Space Complexity

**Time Complexity**

Time complexity is a measure of the number of operations an algorithm performs relative to the input size. Understanding this concept helps in optimizing algorithms to ensure they perform efficiently, even with large inputs.

**Space Complexity**

Space complexity assesses the amount of memory an algorithm needs in addition to the input data. Optimizing for space is crucial in environments with limited memory resources.

```javascript
// Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1)
function calculateAverage(arr) {
  let sum = 0;
  arr.forEach(element => {
    sum += element;
  });
  return sum / arr.length;
}
// This function iterates through the array once to compute the sum, then calculates the average, using a fixed amount of space.
```
