# HTML Forms and Tables

## Introduction

Welcome to Unit 3, where we'll focus on the power of HTML in data collection and representation through forms and tables. By the end of this unit, you'll be highly skilled in creating interactive, accessible forms and organizing data in a tabular format. Let's jump in!

## Lesson 1: HTML Forms for Data Collection

### Introduction to Form Tags

- **`<form>` Element**: The container for all form controls, often with `action` and `method` attributes to specify form processing.

### Different Input Types

- **Text Inputs**: `<input type="text">` for single-line text.
- **Passwords**: `<input type="password">` for password fields.
- **Numbers**: `<input type="number">` for numeric inputs.

### Labels for Accessibility

- **`<label>` Element**: Use with `for` attribute to link it with the corresponding input, improving accessibility.

### Dynamic Elements in Forms

- **Text Areas**: `<textarea>` for multi-line text input.
- **Checkboxes**: `<input type="checkbox">` for multiple options.
- **Radio Buttons**: `<input type="radio">` for single-choice options.
- **Dropdowns**: `<select>` element with nested `<option>` tags.
- **Multi-Select**: Adding `multiple` attribute to `<select>`.
- **File Uploads**: `<input type="file">` for file selection.
- **Functional Buttons**: `<button>` or `<input type="button">` for triggering actions.

## Lesson 2: Crafting Data-Driven Tables

### Foundational Table Structure

- **`<table>` Element**: The container for your tabular data.
- **Rows and Columns**: Created with `<tr>` for table rows and `<td>` for table data.

### Headers and Cell Merging

- **Headers**: Use `<th>` elements for column headers, often within `<thead>`.
- **Colspan and Rowspan**: For merging cells horizontally and vertically.
  
### Advanced Table Features

- **Contextual Captions**: `<caption>` element to provide context to the table.
- **Table Sections**: Utilize `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>` for better structure and styling.
- **Table Sorting**: Implement client-side sorting with JavaScript.
- **Nested Tables**: Placing a `<table>` within another `<table>` for complex layouts.

## Lesson 3: Best Practices and Accessibility

- **Styling and Aesthetics**: Use CSS for better visual representation.
- **ARIA Roles**: Employ ARIA roles and properties to enhance table and form accessibility.
  
## Conclusion: Key Takeaways

- HTML forms are the cornerstone for any kind of data collection on the web, offering a variety of input types and dynamic elements.
- Tables provide an organized way to present complex data, with options for headers, cell merging, and even nesting.
- Accessibility is a must, whether you're collecting data through forms or presenting it through tables.

By mastering these elements, you'll be proficient in building dynamic, interactive forms, and creating rich, organized tables. Great job, and keep pushing ahead!
