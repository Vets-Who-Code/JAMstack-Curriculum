# In-Depth Lesson: Unit 6 - Project Time

## Introduction

Welcome to Unit 6, where we'll take all the knowledge you've gained and apply it to a real-world project: updating your VWC (Vets Who Code) Prework Webpage. This unit will cover layout planning, HTML & CSS updates, responsiveness, debugging, and finally, deployment using GitHub Pages. Let’s dig in!

## Lesson 1: Updating Your VWC Prework Webpage

### Layout Planning

- **Wireframes**: Sketch out your design layout, focusing on both mobile and desktop views.
  
### Updating HTML

- **Semantic Elements**: Use HTML5 semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for better SEO and accessibility.

## Lesson 2: Styling the Webpage

### Applying Tailwind CSS

- **Utility Classes**: Use Tailwind’s utility classes like `.text-lg` and `.bg-gray-100` to style your webpage.
  
### Making it Responsive

- **Breakpoints**: Utilize Tailwind's responsive classes, e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` to adapt the layout for various screen sizes.

## Lesson 3: Review and Deploy

### Debugging

- **Console Errors**: Check for any console errors and resolve them.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensure the site works well in different browsers.

### Deploying using GitHub Pages

- **Repository**: Create a GitHub repository for your project.
- **GitHub Pages**: Deploy your project by enabling GitHub Pages in the repository settings.

### Final Review

- **QA Check**: Do a final quality check, focusing on layout, styling, and responsiveness.

### Next Steps

- **Iterate**: Keep tweaking and updating your webpage as you learn more.
  
### Additional Resources

- **Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs), [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
