# Overview

Conditional statements give your programs the ability to make decisions. Those decisions are made by comparing different values and deciding on the outcome. Conditionals can be read like:

```
if x equals y
  do a thing
or if x equals z
  do a different thing
if none of that is true
  do a this thing instead
```

## Activities

- Make 3 variables
- Compare 2 variables and if they equal each other `console.log` (log) something (like `var 1 and 2 match`).
- Compare the same 2 variables and if one is larger than the other log something else (like `var 1 is larger than var 2`)
- Compare the add the 3rd variable and the first variable. If they add together to equal 20 then log something (like `var 3 and 1 together equal 20`)
- Log something if none of the above cases are true
