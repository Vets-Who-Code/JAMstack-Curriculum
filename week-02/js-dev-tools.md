# Overview

Code isn't just meant to be read/written. It's meant to be run. Code can sometimes get long and quite complicated and hard to keep in your mind. Put up sign posts through out your code helps to remember and understand your code better. These sign posts can look like code comments, function/variable names, and console logs.

## Activities
