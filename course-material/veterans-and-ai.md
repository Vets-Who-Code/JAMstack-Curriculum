# **Introduction**

I’m **Jerome Hardaway**, U.S. Air Force veteran, software engineer, and founder of **Vets Who Code**.

My work has been featured on **StackOverflow, LinkedIn Learning, GitHub,** and **Wired Magazine**, among others.

I’ve led Vets Who Code to generate over **$20.2 million in salaries** for veterans and military spouses.

**Today, we’ll explore how Artificial Intelligence can help address the challenges our community faces, including:**

- **Community representation**
- **Employment transitions**
- **Suicide**
- **Homelessness**

# **What We’ll Cover**

- **Community Representation**
- **Military Veteran Influencers**
- **Employment Transitions**
- **Veteran Suicide**
- **Veteran Homelessness**
- **Mental Health**

# **Community Representation: The Problem**

### **Misrepresentation**:
Veterans are often portrayed as **white, male, retired officers**, which doesn’t reflect our true diversity.

### **Reality**:
- **74%** serve less than 10 years.
- **85%** aren’t combat arms.

Yet, **retired military and officers dominate leadership** and media representation.

---

# **The Issue**:
We cling to military hierarchies, misrepresenting our true diversity.

# **AI’s Role**:
AI can reshape how we connect and **help our community represent itself** more accurately.

---

# **Military Veteran Influencers: A Mixed Impact**

### **Awareness, but no depth**:
Influencers raise awareness but don’t provide **long-term solutions**.

### **Homelessness visibility**:
Focus on homelessness **spikes around holidays** but drops off the rest of the year.

### **Employment success**:
Influencers excel in promoting **employment programs** like Vets Who Code.

---

# **Veteran Suicide: A Crisis We Must Address**

### **Statistics**:
Veterans aged **55-74** are at the highest risk. Younger and older veterans fare better.

### **Firearms**:
Firearms are the number one method of **suicide** for veterans.

### **AI’s Role**:
AI can **analyze behavior patterns**, identify early warning signs, and provide **timely interventions**.

---

# **Veteran Employment: Successes and Challenges**

### **Progress**:
Veteran employment has improved, but many struggle to **translate military experience** into civilian careers. This results in a severe **under-employment** issue.

### **AI Solutions**:
- AI can assess **transferable skills**.
- Create **personalized learning paths**.
- Guide veterans into **new industries**.

### **Example**:
AI helped me transition from **Security Forces** to programming by recommending the right **skills and opportunities**.

# **Veteran Homelessness: A Crisis Still in Need of Solutions**

### **Trends**:
From **2001-2021**, veteran homelessness declined by **55%**, but remains a critical issue in **high-cost urban areas**.

### **Causes**:
- **PTSD**
- **Substance abuse**
- Difficulty transitioning
- Lack of affordable housing

### **AI’s Role**:
AI can predict which veterans are at risk of homelessness and provide **early interventions**.

---

# **How AI Can Help Solve Veteran Homelessness**

### **Predictive Models**:
AI can identify at-risk veterans based on **healthcare visits**, **mental health records**, and **employment history**.

### **Resource Allocation**:
AI can optimize where resources like **housing vouchers** and **mental health services** should go.

### **Personalized Case Management**:
AI can suggest **tailored support** for each veteran, helping case managers intervene more effectively.

# **Conclusion: AI as a Game-Changer**

### **Recap**:
- AI can reshape **community representation**, help with **employment transitions**, prevent **suicide**, and reduce **homelessness**.

### **Message**:
AI isn’t a replacement for **human efforts** but a **tool to enhance them**.

### **Call to Action**:
Let’s work together to use **AI** and **human-centered care** to build systems that better serve veterans.
