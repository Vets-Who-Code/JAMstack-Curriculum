# Overview

It's common in JS to listen for events and setup events. There are a number of events you can listen for and be reactive to.

## Activities

- Add 2 click event listeners to an html element that each log a different string.
- When the element is first clicked remove one of the event listeners.
- On the second click of the element remove the other event listener. On click the element shouldn't have any JS event listeners.
- Add a click event listener that toggles the style of an element.
