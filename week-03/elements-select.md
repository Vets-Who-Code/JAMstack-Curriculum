# Overview

The Document Object Model ([DOM Tree](https://javascript.info/dom-nodes)) is a collection of elements that you can select and update.

## Activities

- Create an HTML page with an `<h1>` that has some text in it. Select it and log `textContent` from that element.
- Create an HTML `<div>` and put a `<p>` inside it with some text. Select the `<div>` and log out the `innerHTML` of that div.
