# Overview

All of the programming done until this point has been synchronous. One action happens after another in a defined sequence. Those actions are pretty much instantaneous. Asynchronous (async) is performing actions with code that take time into account. Examples of this are sending a request to another system (like a database) or performing an action after some time.

## Activities

_note_: The below activities could be done with event listeners. Please try to do them with `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and using `new Promise`.

- When an HTML page loads wait a few seconds and then change the background color of the `<body>`.
- Once the background color is changed then a few seconds later change the color again.
- Set the text of a button to change every few seconds.
