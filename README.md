### Collection I: Web Development Foundations
[#### Module: Command Line](modules/command-line)
---
##### Unit 1: Getting to Know the Command Line

Welcome to "Getting to Know the Command Line." This unit is your gateway into the foundational and advanced concepts of the Command Line Interface (CLI), a cornerstone tool for anyone in tech. Whether you're a budding developer, a system administrator, or simply curious about what lies beyond the graphical user interface (GUI), this section has you covered. We'll begin by demystifying what the command line is, offering both historical context and a comparison with its GUI counterpart. From there, you'll learn why the CLI is not just an alternative but often a preferred environment for speed, versatility, and automation. We'll break down the nuanced relationship between the terminal and shell—two terms often used interchangeably but are fundamentally different in function and form. You'll also get acquainted with popular terminal emulators, diving into customization options and shortcuts. Lastly, we’ll explore the various shell types available—Bash, Zsh, Fish, and Dash—each with its own unique set of features and benefits. By the end of this unit, the command line will be less of a black box and more of a familiar, powerful toolset to aid in your tech journey.

---
##### Unit 2: Basic Commands

Welcome to the unit on "Basic Commands," your stepping stone into the world of command line operations. This unit is designed to get you comfortable with the most essential Unix/Linux commands you'll use on a day-to-day basis. From navigating directories and manipulating files to understanding permissions and disk usage, each lesson here aims to arm you with the fundamental commands and concepts that will make you proficient in terminal-based tasks. In this unit, we'll cover commands like `cd`, `ls`, `cp`, and `chmod`, while also delving into advanced topics like wildcards and file paths. Whether you're setting up a new project, automating routine tasks, or managing system resources, these foundational commands are your building blocks. By the end of this unit, you'll be equipped with a set of practical skills that will make the command line an invaluable part of your toolkit.

---
##### Unit 3: Text Manipulation

Text manipulation is an indispensable skill when working in a command-line environment. This unit delves into the tools and techniques that enable efficient text processing, searching, and editing. We'll kick things off by learning how to view and navigate through large text files using commands like `cat`, `less`, and `more`. Next, we'll introduce text editors such as `nano`, `vi`, and `emacs` that you can use directly from the command line.

Searching for specific text within files is made easy with utilities like `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`. You'll also learn about input and output redirection using symbols like `>`, `>>`, and `|`, and how they can be combined with commands to perform more complex operations. We'll also cover how to compare files and identify differences with commands like `diff` and `comm`.

The unit will also touch on sorting and filtering text through commands such as `sort`, `uniq`, `cut`, and `paste`. Finally, we'll delve into the basics of regular expressions—a powerful feature that can match complex text patterns.

By the end of this unit, you'll have a solid understanding of how to manipulate text files efficiently, perform advanced searches, and automate repetitive tasks. Your journey through this unit will give you the tools to handle a variety of text manipulation challenges that you'll encounter in software development, data analysis, and system administration.
